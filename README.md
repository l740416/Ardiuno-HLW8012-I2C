# Ardiuno-HLW8012-I2C
Interact with HLW8012 ATTINY I2C

# Introduction
HLW8012 meansures power/current/voltage and outputs the measurments using pulse width. It requires extra pins from microcontroller.
This project is using ATTINY to convert HLW8012 readings into I2C protocol. 
The ATTINY ardiuno code (https://github.com/l740416/HLW8012-ATTINY-I2C) is included.
